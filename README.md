# Design-Challenge
This challenge will give you a chance to see what you'll be in for in the UI/UX design class at DevMountain. It also helps us to ascertain your aptitude for the class.

## Step 1
Use index cards and pen or pencil to create wireframes of the screens for a mobile app for listening to music. Tailor your app to a niche consumer group that solves problems not solved by mainstream music apps. Your target audience can be based off of personal research or you  can create a fictitious target audience for your app.

## Step 2
Organize the index cards (screens) with arrows pointing from the applicable buttons to the subsequent card(screen) in the flow. You can do this by taping the index cards to a whiteboard and drawing lines, or take pictures of each index card and use POP (Prototyping on Paper - https://popapp.in) to link the images together to mock-up the interactions or app flow. As you map the interactions pay attention to areas you may have skipped over.

Your wireframe and interactions should contain a minimum of 6 screens. You do not need to wireframe every screen, but you should have a concept of how your app would work and what areas would need to be completed if you were making a full-blown app.

## Step 3
Ask 3 people who would use your music app for feedback. With the feedback, identify a few questions/concerns you have with your wireframes and flow that you would further investigate through more extensive interviewing, prototyping and/or A/B testing if you had more time.

## Step 4
Submit all wireframes and results to interviews@devmounta.in
